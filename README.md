# Data-management-and-Visualization

Businesses in most industries have been impacted either negatively or positively by
the Covid-19 pandemic since its outbreak in March 2020. Covid-19
has created huge uncertainties for businesses and their operations, resulting in difficulties in
adapting to the pandemic and maintaining the same revenues, return on assets and market
capitalization within the supply chain sector.


With the presence of supply chain data for the biggest 505 corporations and with the
uncertainty of Covid-19’s financial impact on the supply chain sector, we perform
explanatory analysis to identify Covid-19’s financial repercussions on these companies.

● Explain and interpret Covid-19’s impact on companies’ revenues, ROA and market capitalization.

● Identify the best & worst performing companies prior to and after Covid-19’s impact.
